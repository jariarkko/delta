changes tend to be incremental, as is again natural for an
organisation that has decades of history around these processes.

the context of bigger trends.  This memo discusses some trends and
other observations in IETF's operating environment and how they might
affect the IETF, and notes some topics for further exploration.

Writing this memo has been inspired by involvement in various

to be able to draw more on understanding trends and their impact
on the IETF.

This memo is also input for discussion that the IETF community should
have.

# Introduction


Naturally, most work at the IETF is technical.  This work goes on in
the working groups, of which there are more than 120.  The
organisation also spends some time rethinking its structure and
processes, but these changes tend to be incremental and responding to
specific issues or opportunities or changes in the environment we work in.
This is again natural for an organisation that has decades of history around
these processes.

Examples of recent non-technical topics include adjusting the IETF
areas to ones suitable for the current work topics, discussion of
IANA stewardship transition, adjustment of NomCom rules, or
increasing diversity.

But sometimes it is useful to view the evolution of an organisation
in light of other developments in the world, and to put the incremental
changes in the context of bigger trends.  This memo discusses some
trends and other observations of the IETF's operating environment and how
they might affect the IETF.  In some cases the memo also presents
some avenues of thought about what good might look like within those trends.
These can be considered when contemplating incremental
changes or more general goals for the IETF.

This memo is NOT focused on technical trends in the technology that
the IETF is developing - while that discussion would be interesting, the
focus of this memo is on things that affect the IETF as an
organisation.

Writing this memo has been inspired by involvement in various
decisions that the IETF leadership has to take part in, often wishing
to be able to draw more on understanding trends and their impact
on the IETF.  Right now we are taking some decisions in a fairly ad
hoc manner, without as much written guidance as we would like to
have.  This memo is also input for discussion that the IETF community
should have, and as a foundation for expressing to the Internet Society the
expectations that that the IETF has of them.

The memo has no particular official standing, nor does it claim to
represent more than the authors' thinking at the time of writing.
Some of the memo may be useful background for the IETF leadership
when they think about new ideas or change proposals.  The memo also
intends to be complementary to existing IETF documents (such as
{{RFC3935}} and ongoing discussions in the community about any specific
topic.  In case of overlap or disagreement those other discussions
shall take precedence.

      Note: There are some topics that are not fully documented in any
      official manner, despite extensive discussion.  For instance,
      there is probably broad agreement about the increasing role of
      open source, but there has not been an RFC about this, to date.

# Problem Statement

When dealing with various IETF related topics - be it about new forms
of working together like the Hackathon, new people and new topics,
ongoing industry transformations, or sponsorships - it is essential to
have an understanding of the trends around us, how they affect the
IETF.  This understanding helps IETF leadership make better decisions,
and the community can decide what our general stance is towards
various broader changes.

Some examples may help illustrate this.

The growing importance of Free and open-source software (FOSS) in networking
technology is one example where we have a common recognition of the trend, and,
the authors believe, pretty strong agreement in the IETF that we need to be a
part of the change, through helping standards and the open source world support
each other, and make their interaction easier.

Similarly, IETF leadership was recently asked if we wanted to hold an IETF
Hackathon outside the IETF meetings.  The timing of this request did not make
it possible to even think about that opportunity, but it opened up a broader
question of what is the scope that we are trying to achieve in our efforts.
There is an increasing number of Hackathon-type events in the world.  Is our
target at the IETF focused on IETF meetings, in existing and new IETF
participants attending those meetings?  Or should our target be broader, such
as additional engagement in the tech community, and in using new technology
coming out of IETF?

A third example is funding.  The IETF needs to understand what
evolution its funding and sponsorship model will see in the coming
years, amidst changing meeting participation style (such as remote
participation) or the increasingly professionally run (outsourced) services
that we utilize.  While participation numbers have been relatively stable,
costs are rising.

A fourth example is the increase in remote participation, which in turn leads
to other effects, including:
- decreased on-site meeting registration revenue
- significant changes under way in how working groups conduct their business
at the main IETF meetings as well as at interim meetings
- fragmentation of the community, resulting from less opportunities for all
participants to engage in in-person interactions and ad hoc "hallway
conversations" which are often among the most valuable aspects of the
meetings for many participants and the source of many serendipitous
connections among attendees.

Being able to understand potential changes is not just important for us.
With the long lead-times involved in implementing changes in an organization
like the IETF, it is important that the community and leadership look ahead
and make plans accordingly, to the extent practical. It is also important for
communicating with the sponsors and other funding sources.  It is a happy
situation that there is a lot of willingness to fund the IETF from all of
these sources.  But the IETF still needs to set the format and terms of this
funding and make the right requests, in a long-term fashion.

Some of these changes and trends may be obvious, and some not so obvious, but
even for the obvious parts I have found that writing down the commonly agreed
truths is useful in increasing our focus on dealing with those truths.  And
some of the topics mentioned above probably eventually deserve their own,
in-depth treatment in a thread or document of their own.  But as the first
step, I would like to get to at least identifying the trends that we need to
talk about.

Are there certain things that are or should be off limits for changing?
For example, the WG ID/RFC process? The IETF mission is well understood and
agreed, but the processes beneath it could use some work to refine and improve.
Interoperability is and will remain a key element in the work we do, ongoing.

A software release or document publication is a valuable rallying point. How
might we more effectively utilize these opportunities to increase our
visibility and effectiveness?

Can the IETF process keep up with open source software development "in the
wild," which is very rapid? What changes could we consider which would serve to
make us more agile and able to accommodate rapidly moving environments?

A key question to consider is what would motivate someone to bring new work
into the IETF, instead of other Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs)? What
kinds of new work make sense to try to attract, and how do we make those
decisions? What could we do better to attract the sorts of new work that are
appropriate for us?

It has been observed that some vendors have been developing things and then
bringing them to the IETF seeking endorsement as a standard. Can and should
this be addressed, and if so, how? How can we encourage people to bring the
problem set to the IETF earlier in the process? On the other side of that
question, how can we as an organization avoid ideas being brought in that seem
to be not fully thought out, and with little or no likelihood of community
adoption. In many cases it seems that the people promoting these ideas are
seeking use cases and problem statements, but not really going anywhere that we
as a community would consider productive. Does the current working group
process adequately address this, and if not, how might it be changed to better
do so?

In contrast to the early days of the Internet, which had the luxury of being
able to work at its own pace, The Internet of Things (IoT) and its associated
market pressures are stepping up the pressure to move rapidly. Does the IETF
have a seat at this table, and should it? If so, how might our processes evolve
to enable us to be better equipped in this arena?

In some cases, this memo also tries to provide some insight about
what situations might be considered useful for the IETF within those
trends.  These insights are meant for discussion, and should not
constrain what the IETF actually does or what goals it sets for
itself.

If the IETF better understood what its environment was doing and how it
wants to evolve, it would be far easier to understand how to react to
various new ideas or challenges that arise.

This would also be helpful in the numerous concrete decisions that
the IETF is facing.  For instance, we are currently undergoing
website redesign, ISOC continues to make decisions regarding how it
helps IETF reach sponsors or how outreach such as the fellows program
is run.  Many of these decisions are tactical ones that would benefit
from understanding the overall direction of the world around us and the
IETF.

#  Goals of the IETF

The starting point of our work is that the IETF does not exist for
the sake of itself.  It exists because (and only if) it can improve
Internet technology, as noted in {{RFC3935}}:

      The goal of the IETF is to make the Internet work better.

The broad purpose of the IETF is therefore Internet technology
improvements.  Historically, the organisation has developed the core
Internet technology, focusing on widely used and usable technologies
rather than more specific technologies.

These technology improvements and extensions are of course only
useful for the Internet, when the IETF can "... produce high quality,
relevant technical and engineering documents that influence the way
people design, use, and manage the Internet ..." [RFC3935].

An often quoted key goal for the IETF work is that it should be
relevant and timely.

# Observations Relating to Participation

Here are some trends and observations relating to participation in
professional organisations such as the IETF:

- Over-the-net participation

   The ability to work together without being in the same place
   continues to improve; global communities can be built based on -
   at least to large extent - over-the-net collaboration.  As
   engineers working on real-time communication among other things,
   this trend should be apparent to IETF participants.  This is not
   to say that in-person meetings will cease to be useful.

   There is always an advantage to in-person meetings, and core
   participants of any significant organisation will find ways to
   arrange such meetings.  IETF meetings will continue to run.
   However, it is just as likely that there will be some participants
   who would prefer an entirely over-the-net participation.  Or, to 
   put it in another way: over-the-net participation significanty 
   enlarges the pool of potential participants.

   Some of the implications of this trend relate to the growth and
   renewal of the IETF participant base, process rules related to
   meeting participation (such as nomcom eligibility), and financing
   models based primarily on meeting fees and meeting sponsorship.

   The IETF might consider evolving its participation models to
   ensure that growth in over-the-net participation is technically
   possible, is an equally attractive alternative for the
   participants, and can be worked as an integral part of participant
   and sponsorship funding arrangements.

   An ideal situation might be meetings with roughly equal number of
   participants as the IETF meetings have today, but a larger number
   of participants that attend only remotely, or only engage outside
   meetings. There are a number of challenges facing current and potential
   participants, including restricted travel budgets, difficulty in obtaining
   visas, inability to leave work commitments for the necessary time, and
   difficulty in understanding and communicating in English.

- Culture
 
   The culture of the IETF is evolving. We have a joint set of values and
   traditions, some of which will stay but some of which will also change, with
   benefits for IETF as an organization as well as for individual participants.

- Ecosystem

   With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) bringing
   numerous types of connected devices and services online, the ecosystem is
   becoming much larger. With this expansion comes the need for more standards,
   and along with the risk of fragmentation if more of this work goes elsewhere
   (to other SDOs), there is also the real risk that the community will see
   additional costs in coordination. It is to our benefit to strengthen the IETF
   brand and to make the IETF and IETF results visible, and to make the IETF the
   preferred forum in which to start new work.

   The IETF brand is core internet technology, and improving the internet,
   not specific new things. The fundamental strength of the internet is that it is
   at the base of so much of our world, and the IETF keeps the internet running.

- Outreach

   It is becoming clear that outreach will be an increasingly important
   component as the IETF moves ahead. This could take many forms:
    - outreach aimed at reaching more people with the message that the IETF
      is the central and key SDO for the Internet
    - outreach as in going out of our way to market our brand
    - outreach as in paying for people from developing regions to
      participate, such as funding travel to IETF meetings or regional hubs

   It will be important for the IETF as a community to understand and come to
   consensus on where on this continuum we want to be.

- Marketing

   This includes being clear about what we are doing, how, and why we do it the way that we do.

- Political perception

   As politics and technology become ever more intertwined, this includes
   things like making a your systems acceptable to various government entities
   with differing ideological and cultural norms. We need to make sure that the
   adoption of and support for open, global standards are percieved as desirable.
   Political acceptance of, and respect for, the IETF is important in this
   context.

   Note that awareness of the bigger ecosystem and political issues may be
   an awareness problem for the IETF community. Should we consider taking steps to
   inform and educate people more about these matters, for example by holding
   informational sessions at relevant events? This might be something that the
   IAB/ISOC/IETF liaisons should be prepared to do more often, on topics not just
   related to the specific organization/event but also other ongoing world
   developments. The current furor over encryption, in the context of public fear
   of terrorist attacks, is an example of the type of opportunity in which the
   IETF could play a valuable role by providing reliable and credible information
   to counter misinformation and misunderstanding among policymakers and the
   press.

- Internal Communication

   Along these same lines, internal communication among the community can
   and should also happen in ways other than meetings. This is something that
   needs to be explored in more depth as well.

- Renewal and Diversity

   Many organisations, IETF included, go through a rapid initial growth
   phase, followed by more stable long-term existence.  It is, however, essential
   that organisations renew themselves, both in terms of how they work and their
   participation.  In particular, the inclusion of new generations of Internet
   technologists is essential to the long-term viability of an Internet standards
   organisation.

   But the renewal can obviously be thought of along different
   dimensions.  An important topic that has generated a lot of
   discussion at the IETF is the topic of diversity.  This is
   important in two ways.  First, creating an environment that is
   good for diverse participants is the right thing to do.  Secondly,
   trends in deployment of the Internet in the developing world, for
   instance, may seem foreign to current participants.  Being able to
   include participants that understand different business and cultural
   environments, different economic conditions, different branches of
   industry, and so on, is essential to developing technology that
   matches needs in those areas.

   The IETF works well due to the continued participation of many people
   with a broad range of expertise. New people are attracted to work within the
   IETF when that expertise adds value to what they are working to achieve (see
   the geojson working group for a recent example). We have a relatively simple
   set of processes, even if it sometimes feels heavy. We have a framework for
   dealing with IPR issues that enables quick and open progress.

- Modes of Participation

   Importantly, we are relatively quick to adapt to new styles of working
   together. We expect groups to self-organize and choose ways of completing their
   work that fit the group best. The xmpp related groups sometimes met, often with
   very little meeting structure, over instant messaging. The httpbis working
   group is making effective use of github to track discussions and develop
   documents. Groups are working with open source communities to build
   implementations and specification together, with quick feedback informing and
   improving each of those tasks. As we evolve, we should find ways to make
   adopting new working techniques even easier.

   As the IETF grows, and people from more diverse parts of the world get
   involved, it might be useful to look at making greater use of remote
   participation to involve greater numbers of people and  get work done.

   - Working Group efforts

   Sometimes, periodic meetings drive work being done.  People naturally
   work to deadlines, and while the IETF meeting 3 times a year does serve as a
   forcing function for work to be completed, these meetings are far apart.  On
   the other hand meeting every two weeks or even monthly can help to drive a more
   uniform and continuous cycle - with more frequent milestones. In order for such
   work to be effective however, some staff support is necessary.  This would have
   budget implications.

   - Meetings

   While some remote participation is used at meetings, it is still awkward.
   Remote contributions, as opposed to just remote listening, often needs to be
   setup in advance. While it is still possible to type something in a chat that
   is read by a jabber scribe, this does not really qualify as remote
   participation. The software exists to do at least bi-directional voice, even if
   there are bandwidth limitation in some remote areas.  It should be largely an
   effort in implementation and education for chairs and others in the use of
   remote participation.

   - Use of hubs

   One way to do augment remote participation and increase diversity is to
   create hubs.  These hubs can participate in the sessions of the main meeting,
   but can also holds sessions in their local time zone on protocols or protocols
   issues that have special local or regional significance.

   They can augment existing IETF meetings and bring some of the benefits of
   face-to-face interactions to those who cannot travel consistently to IETF.
   They may also be able to help crystallize geographically close communities of
   contributors to do technical collaboration.

   While it is possible to participate in the IETF on mailing lists, building
   personal relationships and understanding of the personalities of active
   participants helps greatly in interactions.  Traveling to IETF meetings can
   require justifications of the usefulness to an employer and those benefits are
   hard to articulate without having been there.  It is important that the IETF
   support and encourage not merely highly active "standards people" but also less
   standards-active people - such as developers.

   The IETF has some experience with Remote Hubs from the Internet Society's work
   encouraging them to prepare for the Buenos Aires IETF.  There are several
   factors that would collectively contribute to the success of remote hubs, which
   will be addressed in a separate document.

    - Use of hackathons in the hubs

   There are many developers, especially of FOSS code, around the world in
   location that would never be able to travel to the major IETF meetings. Not
   only would funding be difficult, but visas might be very difficult or
   impossible to obtain. They might be able to improve the tools we are using for
   remote participation  and collaboration.

-  Collaboration Considerations

   Deploying new collaboration tools and methods to established communities such
   as the IETF requires care and planning to ensure success. Leveraging the
   enthusiasm of influential early adopters can be a very effective strategy. In
   SDOs like the IETF, participants might be broadly generalized as those engaged
   because they want to actively contribute and participate and influence the
   direction of the standards and technology, and those who are monitoring
   activity to stay informed about trends and directions that they can incorporate
   into their work, as early adopters. The tools and methods that are most
   effective and acceptable for these two types of participants will vary
   somewhat, and will be addressed in a separate document.

# Observations Relating to Internet Technology Development Styles

Here are some trends relating to how Internet technology is being
developed:

- Open Source

   While open source has always been an important part of various
   Internet developments, in the last couple of years its importance
   has grown significantly.  A big part of networking development
   today happens in open source projects.  The ability of the IETF to
   usefully engage in this space, and provide value for the open
   source developments is essential.  Of course, there is no need for
   the IETF to try to repliate or compete with the open source
   efforts; standards will continue to be useful, but the standards
   need to be such that they and their development style fit with
   open source efforts.

- Rule of Code

   While running code has always been a key feature at the IETF, in
   today's fast-paced world it is even more important.  It is also
   important from the point of view of verifying that work that gets
   done has some useful connection to actual running systems.
   (Necessary but not sufficient condition.)

   As a result, being able to integrate more running code into the
   IETF process and to the IETF as a forum (meetings etc.) is likely
   useful going forward.  Recent experiences with Hackathons,
   interops, and other events are a good experience in this regard.

- Software Definition

   Another trend in the last decade has been about making networking
   as software-defined as possible, through a generally useful but
   minimal framework that allows building new features on top without
   having to, for instance, have the vendor providing a node do the
   programming.

- Permissionless Innovation

   More generally, permissionless innovation, the ability to develop
   features without undue need to coordinate with others, has always
   been a key feature of the Internet.  The success of the web, for
   instance, lies largely in the ability of anyone to program
   underlying frameworks and provide the content, features or
   applications on top without any coordination with anyone.  The
   IETF is small and can not nor should not ever develop specific
   solutions.  The Internet technology community works best when it
   can develop these successful frameworks with suitable amount of
   standards underneath, but leaving all the rest to whoever is
   employing the technology.

   Some might argue that this is the end of standards, being too
   successful with too open-ended solutions that need no further
   standardisation.
